# TippingPoints

This is a project for a virtual toy/game that illustrates the concept of cascading tipping points to children of ages 12-16 (see for example [Tipping Points in the climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system)). 

It is developed for the Max Planck Society for the History of Science & Max Planck Society for Geoanthropology by members of the [ModelSEN project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system).
