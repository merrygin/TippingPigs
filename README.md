# TippingPoints

This is a project for a virtual toy/game that illustrates the concept of cascading tipping points to children of ages 12-16 (see for example [Tipping Points in the climate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system)). 

It is developed for the Max Planck Society for the History of Science & Max Planck Society for Geoanthropology by members of the [ModelSEN project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system).

TODO (more detail: designdoc on nextcloud...):
	
	
make forest regrow
	faster with more trees around
	normal neighborhood (4 sided), because 8 sided probably too resource intensive? 
make pigs notice if target unreachable.
	should factor that in already at decision moment, so they don’t even try to get clogged up at the shore
	should STILL be able to abort if it takes too long
make pigs die/get sad when hungry too long 
make grassland die off too, preventing any regrowth (unless… enough grassland around. so again some kind of all-around check algo)
make villagers?!
	need/use forest too
	are happy with more pigs
	are unhappy with not enough forest
	what about cropland?!
